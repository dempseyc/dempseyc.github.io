This was one of the first things I built with Javascript, and though it is humble jquery stuff, I'm proud of it.  Once I saw how far I could get with no JS animation, I decided to stick to it.  Working within constraints engages my creativity.  I liked the challenge of creating a looping 2D array to simulate the 'planet.'  The design of the 'planet' in the demo is a silouhuette of a Shoebill, The name of my General Assembly Web Dev Immersive cohort.  Just a simple demo, but the further development would be a super small RPG game engine.
